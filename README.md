## üîß API Integration

This application uses the [BlockCypher API](https://www.blockcypher.com/dev/) to fetch Bitcoin blockchain data. The API provides:

- Address information and balances
- Transaction details and history
- Real-time blockchain data
- No authentication required for basic usage

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /v1/btc/main/addrs/{address}` - Address information
- `GET /v1/btc/main/txs/{hash}` - Transaction details

## üéØ Usage

1. **Search an Address**: Enter a Bitcoin address in the search field
2. **View Balance**: See the current balance and transaction count
3. **Explore Connections**: Use the network visualization to see connected addresses
4. **Transaction Details**: Click on any transaction for detailed information
5. **Navigate**: Click on connected addresses to explore further

### Example Addresses
Try these well-known Bitcoin addresses:
- `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa` (Genesis Block)
- `1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2` (BitFinex Cold Wallet)

## üåü Features in Detail

### Address Visualization
The network graph shows how Bitcoin flows between addresses, making it easy to trace transaction paths and identify patterns in Bitcoin usage.

### Real-time Data
All data is fetched in real-time from the Bitcoin blockchain, ensuring you always see the most current information.

### Responsive Design
